## Sleep

The sleep dataset shows the effect of two soporific drugs (increase in hours of sleep compared to control) on 10 students.

```{r load}
library(knitr)
data(sleep)
kable(head(sleep))
```

## Extra hours of sleep vs drug given

```{r plot1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(sleep, y = ~extra, color = ~group, type = "box")
```

## Slide with R Output

```{r plot2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_ly(sleep, x= ~ID, y = ~extra, color = ~group, type = "scatter")
```

## Thanks!!!
